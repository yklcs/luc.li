This is my first post on <Link to="/blog">luc.li/blog</Link>. Just testing stuff out.

## Why Gatsby?

This site uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) to provide SSR/SSG for React.
While this approach may seem overkill for a static blog, not having to deal with the DOM _greatly_ improves DX.
React's VDOM and Gatsby's build system, combined with CSS-in-JS and other modern web technologies, provides a far superior DX over traditional SSGs at a small cost of bundle size.
When you're writing posts for a blog that people may not even see, good DX keeps you motivated longer.

Some RFC pull requests are tagged with the "postponed" label when they are closed (as part of the rejection process). An RFC closed with "postponed" is marked as such because we want neither to think about evaluating the proposal nor about implementing the described feature until some time in the future, and we believe that we can afford to wait until then to do so. Historically, "postponed" was used to postpone features until after 1.0. Postponed pull requests may be re-opened when the time is right. We don't have any formal process for that, you should ask members of the relevant sub-team.

Usually an RFC pull request marked as "postponed" has already passed an informal first round of evaluation, namely the round of "do we think we would ever possibly consider making this change, as outlined in the RFC pull request, or some semi-obvious variation of it." (When the answer to the latter question is "no", then the appropriate response is to close the RFC, not postpone it.)

Some accepted RFCs represent vital features that need to be implemented right away. Other accepted RFCs can represent features that can wait until some arbitrary developer feels like doing the work. Every accepted RFC has an associated issue tracking its implementation in the Rust repository; thus that associated issue can be assigned a priority via the triage process that the team uses for all issues in the Rust repository.

The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it. Of course, the RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted.

If you are interested in working on the implementation for an "active" RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is already working on it, feel free to ask (e.g. by leaving a comment on the associated issue).

## Features

### Typography

The typeface used is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter).
I considered using the system font stack, but decided against it as I'm not a big fan of Roboto or Segoe.
**This is bold**, and _this is italic_. ~~Strikethrough too!~~

### $\LaTeX$ rendering

$\LaTeX$ support is important to me, and it's rendered via $\KaTeX$ (with `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`) on the server for this blog.
Here's an inline equation: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
Of course, display mode is supported too.

$$
\ddot{x}+2\gamma\dot{x}+{\omega_0}^2 x = 0
$$

### Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is also done on the server, powered by `prism-react-renderer`.
This is preferable over comparable `remark` plugins as it allows for the use of `styled-components`.

```js
const a = 10
const addOne = n => n + 1
addOne(a)
```
