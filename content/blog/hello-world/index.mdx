description: First blog post, testing out MDX

This is my first post on <Link to="/blog">luc.li/blog</Link>. Just testing stuff out.

## Why Gatsby?

This site uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org) to provide SSR/SSG for React.
While this approach may seem overkill for a static blog, not having to deal with the DOM _greatly_ improves DX.
React's VDOM and Gatsby's build system, combined with CSS-in-JS and other modern web technologies, provides a far superior DX over traditional SSGs<Sidenote>Hugo, 11ty, etc. Oh cool, a sidenote!</Sidenote> at a small cost of bundle size.
When you're writing posts for a blog that people may not even see, good DX keeps you motivated longer.

## Features

### Typography

The typeface used is [Inter](https://rsms.me/inter).
I considered using the system font stack, but decided against it as I'm not a big fan of Roboto or Segoe.
**This is bold**, and _this is italic_. ~~Strikethrough too!~~

### $\LaTeX$ rendering

$\LaTeX$ support is important to me, and it's rendered via $\KaTeX$ (with `remark-math` and `rehype-katex`) on the server for this blog.
Here's an inline equation: $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$.
Of course, display mode is supported too.

$$
\ddot{x}+2\gamma\dot{x}+{\omega_0}^2 x = 0
$$

### Syntax highlighting

Syntax highlighting is also done on the server, powered by `prism-react-renderer`.
This is preferable over comparable `remark` plugins as it allows for the use of `styled-components`.

```js
const a = 10
const addOne = n => n + 1
addOne(a)
```
