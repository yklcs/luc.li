Korea has two of what I consider to be the best examples of "everything apps" - apps that contain everything - Naver and Kakaotalk. These apps are deeply intertwined with daily lives in Korea.

To give an idea, the Naver app (360MB) includes the following:

- Search engine
- News (+ weather, sports, entertainment)
- Email
- Bookmarking
- Payment provider
- Cafe (Forums)
- Blog
- Ask
- Shopping
- Webtoons
- KYC
- Maps
- and more

While the Kakaotalk app includes:

- Chatting
- Shopping
- Payments
- Ordering
- Gifting
- Mail
- and more

Out of all the features listed above, Naver has its roots in search, and Kakaotalk in messaging.
Search engines and messengers are what could be described as _killer apps_, apps that are innovative enough to affect computing paradigms.
They are apps that users open dozens of times a day with high total screen time, making them the perfect candidates to monetize through added features.

The two apps follow the same playbook:

- "Killer app" close to users' lives
- Promote own features and content based on closed platform
- Add features into app with growing levels of complexity and monetization
- Use platform to diversify into content market
- Incubate features before spinning them off into new apps

Both apps are based on a closed platform. Naver has a closed search graph, promoting its own blog engines

Whether Kakaotalk and Naver are playing it fair is a difficult matter. Kakao and Naver have been the target of antitrust probes as corporations.

What is clear, however, is that tech megacorps such as Kakao and Naver have a much lower barrier to market entry compared to smaller companies.

Everything apps allow corporations to gain a near complete view into a userâ€™s life, including shopping,

Open standards can work if applied to messaging.
This is far more than that - an open standard for booking your hairdresser is implausible.

Recently during COVID-19, an open standard was made.
