## Groceries

### Meat

Some RFC pull requests are tagged with the "postponed" label when they are closed (as part of the rejection process).
An RFC closed with "postponed" is marked as such because we want neither to think about evaluating the proposal nor about implementing the described feature until some time in the future, and we believe that we can afford to wait until then to do so.
Historically, "postponed" was used to postpone features until after 1.0.
Postponed pull requests may be re-opened when the time is right.
We don't have any formal process for that, you should ask members of the relevant sub-team.

Usually an RFC pull request marked as "postponed" has already passed an informal first round of evaluation<Sidenote>This is an example of a sidenote used to convey secondary information. Absolutely awesome.</Sidenote>,
namely the round of "do we think we would ever possibly consider making this change,
as outlined in the RFC pull request, or some semi-obvious variation of it."
(When the answer to the latter question is "no", then the appropriate response is to close the RFC, not postpone it.)

### Vegetables

#### Broccoli

Some accepted RFCs represent vital features that need to be implemented right away.
Other accepted RFCs can represent features that can wait until some arbitrary developer feels like doing the work.
Every accepted RFC has an associated issue tracking its implementation in the Rust repository; thus that associated issue can be assigned a priority via the triage process that the team uses for all issues in the Rust repository.

#### Is tomato a vegetable or not?

The author of an RFC is not obligated to implement it.
Of course, the RFC author (like any other developer) is welcome to post an implementation for review after the RFC has been accepted.

## Another H2 tag

If you are interested in working on the implementation for an "active" RFC, but cannot determine if someone else is already working on it, feel free to ask (e.g.
by leaving a comment on the associated issue).
