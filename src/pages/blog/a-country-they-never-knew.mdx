As a Korean soldier serving under the [KATUSA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korean_Augmentation_To_the_United_States_Army) program,
the most notable thing about my fellow U.S. Army soldiers
is that they are protecting a _foreign_ country.
Following the footsteps of those who served before them,
they have come thousands of miles to protect
_"a country they never knew and a people they never met."_[^1]
