## Webpage

### Development

This site uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) for React static site generation.
All source code is available publicly on [github.com/yklcs/luc.li](https://github.com/yklcs/luc.li) under GPLv3.
TypeScript is used for a sane development experience, and CSS-in-JS styling is done with styled-components.

### Hosting

No backend is used, following a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) approach.
Instead, static hosting is done on AWS S3, with the site being served behind AWS CloudFront.
The site is built with [Github Actions](https://github.com/yklcs/luc.li/actions) then uploaded to S3.

## Design

### Typography

[Suisse Int'l](https://www.swisstypefaces.com/fonts/suisse/) by Swiss Typefaces is used as the primary sans serif font.
XCharter is used as the serif body text font.
