## Frontend

### Gatsby

This site uses [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.com) for React static site generation.
All source code is available publicly on [github.com/rocketll/luc.li](https://github.com/rocketll/luc.li) under GPLv3.
TypeScript is used for a sane development experience, and styling is done with styled-components.

### Tooling

ESLint and Stylelint are used for linting, and Prettier is used for formatting.
Linting/formatting is done at the pre-commit stage via Husky + Lint-staged.

### Hosting

No backend is used, following a [Jamstack](https://jamstack.org/) approach.
Instead, static hosting is done on AWS S3, with the site being served behind AWS CloudFront.
